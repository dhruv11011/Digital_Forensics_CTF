                <p class="question">What is CTF in terms of cybersecurity ?</p>
                <p class="answer">Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are
                    secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. Don't worry here you don't need to
                    hack any application these CTFs are very easy and made to give you a glimpse of actual CTF. These
                    Labs are made focusing on the knowledge of our participants.</p>

                <h3>Types of CTF:</h3>

                    <li>Jeopardy CTF / Red-Team</li>
                    <li>Attack & Defense CTF / Red-Team-Blue_team</li>

                <p class="question">How to play ?</p>
                <p class="answer">You are given 5 Labs to solve. Hints are available in every lab, read properly
                    whatever hints are given. Difficulty will increase as you go on solving labs. Google along with
                    other online sites will help you to capture the flag. your googling skills matter during the
                    competition. The first two labs will be easy and you will be guided in these 2 labs but next 3 labs
                    you have to do yourself with hints available or with your thinking capabilities.</p>

        <ul>
            Welcome to the CTF challenge! You will begin your journey on Machine 1, accessible at IP address<strong>
                13.229.78.95 </strong> This machine is running an Apache2 web server and hosts various OSINT resources,
                including
                information on location and findings such as follower counts, status, and many more. Within this
                environment, you will
                uncover hidden routes that lead to a Google Drive link containing a corrupted file. This file holds critical
                data, including the IP address of Machine 2 and a photo of the victim.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Once you’ve gathered enough information from Machine 1, you’ll move on to Machine 2. This machine requires
                SSH port knocking for access and contains 50 files, each holding valuable data that may lead you to Flag 2.
                Among these files, one will provide a <strong>Google Drive link</strong> that includes two items: an audio
                file with a key
                that can be inferred from the accompanying image. Use your skills to connect the dots and reveal Flag 3.
                Throughout this challenge, utilize the hints and tools provided in the reference section to aid in your
                mission. Good luck!
